In Kenya, low capacity in health informatics expertise, low capacity in using technology amongst healthcare professionals to whom this systems are made add to the difficulty of efficiently integrating this technology with their day to day tasks. This is made worse by a lack of studies in the field which make it difficult to learn from the mistakes of others and has contributed to the high rate of failure.</p><p>This is changing. Health informatics expertise is growing and is getting a larger appreciation by policy makers and healthcare professionals alike. The Kenya Health Informatics Association KEHIA is possibly one of the largest conglomeration of diverse experts in health informatics in Africa. They bring significant experience in implementing successful and also health informatics initiatives that have fallen short of expectations in a landscape which has its own unique challenges. \\u00a0</p><p>Through sharing experiences, KEHIA will aim to disseminate knowledge to a broad spectrum of healthcare stakeholders on a wide range of health technology related areas.<br/></p>\"}]"
